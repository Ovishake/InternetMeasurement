# InternetMeasurement
Based on PAXON'96 paper by Vern Paxson where we take measurement across servers located in various geographies. We studied concepts
like Triangular Routing, Fluttering, Lost Probes etc.
Using Python Script and shell script.
Challenges Faced:
1. Identifying working servers across geography.
2. Server Up-time
3. Cleaning the data.
4. Plotting the data obtained and making observations from the data
